    "In this project it is possible to undertake the neural network training on a local PC. Students from earlier cohorts however found that the computational power to train the model to a level that receives a passing submission could exceed 12 hours. As a solution Udacity has encouraged students to use AWS EC2 cloud computing services which offer much greater and more appropriate (i.e. GPU) computing resources. Student credits were also available for use to undertake the training.\n",

I then uploaded all the project data downloaded in Step 1 to my DeepLearning-Project repository. \n",

I simply struggled to collect good examples of images when the drone was either following the hero or simply on patrol.\n",

    "A key lesson learned here is that I have dedicated subtantial time to fine tuning my Hyper Parameters (Step 5) as a substitute for collecting more training data. I chose to focus my efforts on tuning the Hyper Parameters instead of collecting more data because of the success other students have expressed on Slack with the Udacity provided dataset."
